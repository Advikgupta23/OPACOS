The framework developed is useful in order to get the probability distribution of parameter of stars as observed by us synthetically for a section of our Sky. Using above framework we can get the ditribution function of parameters for a section of sky which can be used as a prior in Galactic surveys.

Our framework can be used to get the probability distribution of metallicity or age given priors of (age,distance) or (metallicity, distance) respectively. It accounts for selection effects and generates a probabilty distribution of parameters as would be seen by us for a section of sky.

The above framework is divided into two components:
- The first component which uses the extinction code ALextin and the probability calculation code that we created and calculates the probability of observing stars.
- The second component which uses the probability along with the GALAXIA code results in order to simulate the parameter distribution of stars that we would observe. Here GALAXIA is a simulation code which simulates the Galaxy for us which we sample for pur use.
