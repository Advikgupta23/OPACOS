in both extin.pro and extinspiral.pro I have changed the adopted distance of 
the Sun to the Galactic centre, using the preferred value of 8.27 kpc from 
Schoenrich (2012,MNRAS, 427,274). Notice that the geometrical scale of these 
models is poorly know: usually it's better to have some sort of constraint on 
reddening in the field studied, and to recalibrate/rescale the reddening maps 
upon this constraint.
